## Overview

 This project is to train our own supervised machine learning model using Iris Flower Classification Project with Machine Learning. Through this project, we learned about machine learning, data analysis, data visualization, model creation, etc.


## Getting Started

This gives the overview of the project with the features and prerequisites.

### Features

List the key features and capabilities of your Iris Recognition system, such as:

1. Load the data
2. Analyze and visualize the dataset
3. Model training.
4. Model Evaluation.
5. Testing the model.

### Prerequisites

List the prerequisites or dependencies that users need to have installed before they can use your system. Include links to download and install these prerequisites if possible.

For example:

- Python 3.7 or higher
- NumPy
- seaborn
- matplotlib
- etc.
